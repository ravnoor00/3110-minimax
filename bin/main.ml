         To play Connect4, you are essentially trying to connect 4 of your\n\
         tokens to make a line of 4 tokens. This line can be made vertically,\n\
         horizontally, or diagonally. Upon each alternating turn between\n\
         players, the other player may try to block your connection of 4\n\
         tokens. You must try to also block the other player's connection\n\
         to prevent them from winning. The first player who makes a\n\
         connection of 4 tokens wins the round. In easy, medium, and hard \n\
         mode, you are playing against an AI. In easy mode, which is aimed for\n\
         beginner players, the hypothetical best move will be given to the\n\
         player. In multiplayer mode, you can play against another person on \n\
         the same computer, taking alternating turns. In every mode, you can \n\
         see the score of your player and your opponent. The score increments \n\
         by 1 for the winner of each round. You can play another round by \n\
         selecting a playing option when prompted to enter a number option at \n\
         the end of a round. The scores for the rounds will tally up after \n\
         each round, and be displayed after each game is completed.\n\n\
